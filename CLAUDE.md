In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision. 

At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

All commit messages should be one line and follow conventional commits. Don't mention claude code in the commit message
